# 7. Importing data to ArcGIS Online

First, you’ll have to set yourself up with a free ArcGIS Online public account.

1. Open ArcGIS Online: https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html , and Sign in. If you don’t have an account, you can create one for free or use your Google, Facebook or Github account.

Once you’ve logged in let’s open a new map project. 

1. Select “Map” in the main menu.

Let’s get acquainted with the interface.

Now let’s import and format our neighborhoods shapefile.

1. Click on **Add**.
2. Click **Add Layer from File**. 
3. Select **Choose File**. And navigate to where you have the zipped/compressed “NYCntaPerBlack” file saved on your computer.
4. Feel free to leave the option “Generalize features for web display” selected. I’ve tried making maps with both this option and “Keep original features” and I’ve never noticed any difference. 
 5. Click **Import Layer**.

You should now see something that looks like a map of New York City, colored in by the Borough or another attribute. ArcGIS automatically selects an attribute to use to show on the map.
